TEAM INDIGO - Audio Denoising via Wavelet Transform <br><br>
Short description: Artificial noise will be added to a clean audio recording, various wavelets with different thresholds will then be applied to the noisy signal to denoise the recording. The main objective is to rule out which wavelet performs best in filtering audio signals. <br><br>
Project Features:<br> 
1) Utilization of Wavelet Transform in Denoising Audio Signals<br>
2) Compare Feasibility based on the Performances of the Wavelets or their Combinations<br>
3) Conclude which Wavelet to use or which Combination of Wavelets to use to Denoise Audio Signals<br>
